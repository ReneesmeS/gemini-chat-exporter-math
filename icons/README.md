# Icons

Icons for this extension are included in the `icons/` directory:

- `icon16.png` (16×16)
- `icon48.png` (48×48)
- `icon128.png` (128×128)

If you need to regenerate or redesign icons:
- Use the scripts: `icons/create_icons.py` and `icons/make_icons.py`.
- Or use a design tool (Figma, Sketch, Illustrator) and export PNGs to this directory.

Design notes:
- Keep icons simple and legible at small sizes.
- Recommended palette (optional): primary `#667eea`, accent `#764ba2`.

For temporary testing assets you can use simple placeholders, but replace them with the final icons before publishing or releasing the extension.

## Design Suggestions

For brief guidance: keep icons simple and legible at small sizes; avoid excessive detail. Recommended (optional) palette: primary `#667eea`, accent `#764ba2`.

If you prefer external help, design using your favourite tool and export PNGs to this directory. Use the available `icons/create_icons.py` and `icons/make_icons.py` scripts to regenerate assets when needed.

Save final icons as:
- `icon16.png`
- `icon48.png`
- `icon128.png`
